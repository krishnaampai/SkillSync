# SkillSync

SkillSync is a platform designed to help users find people with matching skills for collaboration on projects. It enables users to create a profile with their skills, interests, and availability, and connect with others based on shared expertise or learning goals.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign in using Firebase Authentication to manage user accounts securely.
- **Profile Management**: Users can create and update their profiles with details such as skills, interests, bio, and availability.
- **Search for Collaborators**: Users can search for other users with specific skills or interests.
- **Matching Logic**: SkillSync uses a matching algorithm to suggest users based on their skills and availability.
- **Firebase Integration**: The app is integrated with Firebase for user authentication and data storage.

### Firestore Structure

  - `skills`: Array of skills the user has
  - `interests`: Array of skills/topics the user wants to learn
  - `experienceLevel`: User's experience level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)
  - `availability`: User's available time for collaboration (e.g., weekends, evenings)
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp when the profile was created
  - `updatedAt`: Timestamp of the last profile update
